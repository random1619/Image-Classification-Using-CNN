# Image Classification

This repository provides an end-to-end solution for **Image Classification**, utilizing state-of-the-art deep learning models to classify images into predefined categories. It includes preprocessing pipelines, model training, evaluation, and deployment examples.

## Features

1. **Preprocessing Pipelines**:  
   - Resize images to standard dimensions for consistent input.  
   - Augmentation techniques like random rotations, flips, and zoom to increase dataset diversity.  
   - Image normalization to scale pixel values, ensuring faster convergence.

2. **Deep Learning Models**:  
   - Implement custom CNN architectures for image feature extraction.  
   - Support for popular frameworks: TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras.  
   - Fine-tune models using transfer learning with pre-trained models like ResNet, VGG, and EfficientNet.

3. **Model Customization**:  
   - Flexible model architecture that can be tailored to your needs.  
   - Hyperparameter tuning for optimizing model performance, including options for learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs.

4. **Evaluation Metrics**:  
   - Performance evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  
   - Visualize the confusion matrix to identify misclassifications and areas for improvement.

5. **Deployment Examples**:  
   - Provide examples for deploying models via Flask, FastAPI, or Streamlit for serving image classification predictions.
