# Image Classification Using CNN
 This repository provides an implementation of Image Classification, a key task in computer vision where images are categorized into predefined classes. The project demonstrates the process of building, training, and deploying a model to classify images efficiently.

#Features
Preprocessing pipelines for image datasets (resizing, augmentation, normalization).
Implementation of deep learning models like CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) for feature extraction.
Support for multiple frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Keras.
Customizable model architecture and hyperparameter tuning.
Pre-trained models (e.g., ResNet, VGG, EfficientNet) for transfer learning.
Evaluation metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix visualization.
Deployment examples (e.g., Flask, FastAPI, or streamlit for model serving).
